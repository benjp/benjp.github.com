<h1>Add QRCode in your Website using Juzu</h1>

<hr/>

Before going further in this post, I want to thank Julien. Thanks to Juzu Web Framework for portlet and portal, I can now create portlets the quick way, and it's important because I have time to test and develop things but not a LOT of time.

So, if you want more info about Juzu, you can go on Github :
<a target="_new" href="https://github.com/juzu/juzu">https://github.com/juzu/juzu</a>

This post is about two things :
- Showing how easy it is to create a portlet using Juzu (I hope Julien won't be upset about my way of taking it :-) )
- Adding QRCode in your website.

<h2>About QRCode</h2>
I won't go into all the detail about the QRCode interest, if you want more info, go to wikipedia.
<a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code</a>

Now, if you want to integrate it in your website, there's the server way (by generating the QRCode image on server side), and there's the "lazy" way (using javascript on client side). I prefer the second way for now because I want to test Juzu more than I want to integrate QRCode in a final product. I'll go maybe later in the server side mode to go further in the controller process in Juzu... or I'll take another use case.
I used a QRCode JS library developed as a jQuery plugin :
<a target="_new" href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/jquery-qrcode/">http://jeromeetienne.github.com/jquery-qrcode/</a>

Firstly, I started with a gadget :
<a target="_new" href="https://github.com/benjp/exosamples/tree/master/gadgets/qrcode-project">https://github.com/benjp/exosamples/tree/master/gadgets/qrcode-project</a>

But, as gadgets are embedded in IFrame, I was not happy about the reactivity of this choice. I mean, you show the page and you have a glitch to show the QRCode, I found this "unpleasant" to watch.

So, I decided to go on the portlet way.

<h2>About Juzu</h2>

Again, you can go on Github to learn more about Juzu, I won't explain it, Julien does it better than me.
But I can say one thing : 
<b>From scratch to first deploy of the QRCode portlet in eXo Platform, it took me 15 minutes (including forking in my GitHub)</b>
That's the only important thing to my eyes.

<h2>Create your project</h2>
<h3>Follow my Steps :</h3>
<blockquote>
- you can either start from scratch or fork a sample project created by Julien
- I chose the second option
-- Forking to <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/benjp/wcm-qrcode">https://github.com/benjp/wcm-qrcode</a>
-- Then, cleaning and preparing the qrcode portlet structure
</blockquote>

At this step, after the <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/benjp/wcm-qrcode/commit/f9dab99883d97084fc8ab0d3f7c8016ebf54818c">initial commit</a>, you can start to play.

<h2>Add QRCode library</h2>
Easy step, you take the js library and integrate it in the portlet filter.
in <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/benjp/wcm-qrcode/blob/master/src/main/java/org/gatein/portal/qrcode/portlet/ResponseFilter.java">ResponseFilter</a>
<pre><code>Element jqq = response.createElement("script");
jqq.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
jqq.setAttribute("src", request.getContextPath() + "/js/jquery.qrcode.min.js");
response.addProperty(MimeResponse.MARKUP_HEAD_ELEMENT, jqq);
</code></pre>

in our <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/benjp/wcm-qrcode/blob/master/src/main/java/org/gatein/portal/qrcode/templates/index.gtmpl">index.gtmpl</a> :
<pre><code>&lt;div id="qrcode_div"&gt;&lt;/div>
&lt;script>
      $('#qrcode_div').qrcode("this is a test");
&lt;/script>
</code></pre>

<h2>Getting the url</h2>
in our <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/benjp/wcm-qrcode/blob/master/src/main/java/org/gatein/portal/qrcode/templates/index.gtmpl">index.gtmpl</a> :
<pre><code>
var url = document.URL;
$('#qrcode_div').qrcode({'width':100, 'height':100, text: url});
$('canvas').css({'margin-left': 'auto', 'margin-right': 'auto', 'display': 'block', 'background-color': '#FFF', 'padding': '10px'});
</code></pre>

<h2>Final Result</h2>

<a target="_new" href="http://paillereau.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/qrcode-portlet.jpg"><img src="http://paillereau.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/qrcode-portlet.jpg" alt="" title="qrcode-portlet" width="495" height="338" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-145" /></a>

<h2>Next Step</h2>

The next step will be to be able to change the QRCode size using a portlet preference.
We will see that in another post.
